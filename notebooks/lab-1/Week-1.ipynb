    "**Kernal** : The kernel in a Jupyter Notebook is like the brain of the notebook. It’s the \"computational engine\" that runs your code. When you write code in a notebook and ask it to run, the kernel is what takes that code, processes it, and gives you the results.\n",

    "A cell in a Jupyter Notebook is like a block or a section where you write your code or text (notes). You can write a piece of code or some explanatory text in a cell, and when you run it, the code will be executed, or the text will be rendered (displayed). Cells help you organize your work in a notebook, making it easier to test small chunks of code and explain what’s happening as you go along.\n",
